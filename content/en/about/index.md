The ClusterCockpit project is a collaborative effort to develop a job-specific performance and energy monitoring framework for HPC clusters. The NHR center NHR@FAU is the lead developer with contributions from several other HPC centers. All ClusterCockpit components are made available under the MIT open source license and are freely available for download from our GitHub page. In addition to software development, the ClusterCockpit project is also actively working on establishing format and interface standards for HPC monitoring environments.

ClusterCockpit can be used as a complete integrated monitoring solution, but components can also be integrated with external components. All components are developed in the [Go](https://go.dev) programming language. The web frontend UI is implemented as reusable [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) components.

ClusterCockpit is stable and is used in production at several large HPC data centers. Contact us if you are interested in deploying ClusterCockpit at your center. We can also help you plan and set up ClusterCockpit at your site.
