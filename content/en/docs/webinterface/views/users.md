This view lists all users which are, and were, active on the configured clusters. Information about the total number of jobs, walltimes and calculation usages are shown.

It is possible to filter the list by username using the equally named prompt, which also accepts partial queries.

The [filter component]({{< ref "filters" >}} "Filter") allows limitation of the returned users based on job parameters like start timestamp or memory usage.

The table can be sorted by clicking the respective icon next to the column headers.
